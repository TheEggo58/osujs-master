# osujs-master
**This is an osu! client written entirely in Scratch. (TurboWarp)**

This is the latest (and last build) of stable client based on this code design.

It's heavily dependant on receivers and the code is pretty cluttered.
So don't expect much, however:

Feel free to mess around with it. That means: you're free to modify this client to your heart's content, (you even have the permission to publish your own client mods) 
as long as you credit the original creator. (which is TheEggo/ZeroChan58 for those who aren't familiar with the project.) And must contain the README file.

This version is "menu-only", meaning it lacks any gameplay, online functionality etc.

**Recommended TurboWarp settings:**

Framerate: 60
Interpolation: Off
High Quality Pen: On
Warp Timer: On

Infinite Clones: On
Remove Fencing: On
Remove Micellaneous limits: On

Stage Size: 1280x720

Disable compiler: Off recommended when editing, otherwise leave this on.
